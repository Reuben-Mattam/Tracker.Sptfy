Spotify Music Tracker  
To use this program to track your own spotify stats, you need to set up a Spotify for Developer's app to access the web API. You can do so here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard.  
From there, you will need to set up a .env file with the following credentials

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=  
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=  
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback  
  
Running the program through command prompt will then save all your spotify music listening habits to spotify_songs.xlsx. For easy viewing of your stats, check out https://github.com/Reuben-Mattam/Stats.Sptfy.
